# Legacy Files

This folder contains the original installation scripts and configuration files before the major refactoring.

## Contents

- `a1_ns3_prep.sh`: Original NS3 preparation script
- `b2_ns3_install.sh`: Original NS3 installation script  
- `c3_ns3ai_install.sh`: Original NS3-AI installation script
- `venv_name.txt`: Original virtual environment configuration

## Purpose

These files are kept for:

- **Failsafe backup** in case issues arise with the refactored version
- **Reference** for comparing old vs new implementations
- **Historical preservation** of the original script structure
- **Debugging support** when troubleshooting installation issues

## Note

These legacy files are not used by the current automated workflow. The active scripts are in the repository root directory with the new streamlined structure and comprehensive documentation.

For current usage, refer to the main `README.md` in the repository root and use the updated installation scripts:
- `a_ns3_prep.sh`
- `b_ns3_install.sh` 
- `c_ns3ai_install.sh`
- `run_all_install.sh`
